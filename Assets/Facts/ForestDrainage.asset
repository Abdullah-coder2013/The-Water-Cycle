  - factText: Percolation can end up in two ways. In the first layer of the ground,
      colored green, it can be picked up from plant roots and can be sent back to
      the clouds through transpiration, or it can navigate through the other layers.

  - factText: After the droplet travels through the ground into dripstone caves,
      (Which can take millions of years by the way) the water then can be frozen
      because of the temperature, or it can be deposited into rivers or oceans.
