  - factText: Precipitation is the act of water falling down from the sky in many
      forms.

  - factText: Rain occurs, because the drops in the clouds become to heavy after
      condensation to stay in the cloud.

  - factText: Hail forms, when updrafts from thunderstorms carry the rain droplets
      into cold areas. There, the drops collide with supercooled water and create
      layers of ice which makes up the hailstone's surface.

  - factText: Snow forms, when temperatures lower to 0 or negative degrees celcius
      as the raindroplets form into ice crystals and the crystals collide as they
      fall to the ground. A seed for snowflakes can be small pieces of debris, like
      dirt particles or pollen.

  - factText: Another piece of information that I want to give you before we move
      on to the next step, is how acid rain forms. As you can see in the game, when
      rain droplets collide with sulfer dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) as
      well as oxygen, the rain becomes acidic because of a chemical reaction.

  - factText: This happens mainly because of artificial substances like the exaust
      of cars, which make nitrogen oxides, or burning fossil fuel, which creates
      sulfur dioxide. However, it can also happen because of volcanic eruptions,
      but it is very rare.
